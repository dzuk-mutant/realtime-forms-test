# Realtime Forms Test

A testing ground for the WIP realtime-forms package.

This test contains various edited code elements from [Parastat](https://parast.at) (an open source project, currently under closed development until a certain point in the future) and because that is licensed CNPL v4, this example is also licensed [CNPL v4](license.txt).

The styles have been built separately as part of Parastat's own UI framework, this has been done for the sake of convenience but because this is about Elm logic, the original styles are not included and do not need to be built.

Requires Elm 0.19.1 and uglifyjs to build.

What will eventually be the realtime forms package is in Form.elm and it's various submodules (Field, Validatable, Validator).
